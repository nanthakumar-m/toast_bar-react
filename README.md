# 🔔 Toast Bar – React

The Toast Bar App is a React-based UI component that displays short-lived notification messages (toasts) on user interaction. It simulates the behavior of system alerts or messages often seen in modern web apps, providing immediate feedback to user actions.

This project was built to explore how temporary UI components can be managed in React. It helped reinforce concepts such as conditional rendering, timers, and state-based UI updates.
